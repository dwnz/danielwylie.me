                Our goal for 2017 was to get all four "points" of the North Island - Cape Egmont, East Cape, Cape
                Palliser and Cape Reinga.
            </p>

            <p>
                Having had a few mechanical issues with the truck in the lead up to Christmas holidays, I was getting a
                tad concerned our trip might be slightly different... But as luck would have it, everything got sorted
                the week before the break and our plan was set in motion - get to Auckland and then spend the next few
                days taking the long way to the top of the island!
