            <h3>About</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">

            <p>
                I'm a 27-year-old software developer living in Wellington, New Zealand. I love working anything that
                involves mobile, a bit of scale and HTML/CSS, and exploring new approaches to problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a passion for technology based start ups and businesses, having attempted a few myself and from
                being involved with small companies that have grown quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Proficient in the Microsoft stack, I am comfortable working with C#, SQL, ASP.NET, MVC, Windows Azure,
                HTML, JavaScript and CSS, to name a few. My quest for knowledge in the latest technologies never tires -
                I'm always on the lookout for the next "thing" and ways to improve processes and work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of the Microsoft stack I have extensive experience in the awesome world of NodeJS and MongoDB,
                having picked it over .NET for my two most recent products. To complement Node, I've spent the effort
                learning Grunt, SASS and other open source tools to extend my knowledge of what can be done.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy big picture thinking and debates - I'm not scared to bring new ideas to the table or get dirty
                implementing said ideas. Being part of a social team where conversation is free flowing and encouraged
                is important to me to both create friendships and to have an enjoyable workspace.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, my hobbies tend to move away from the technology world,
                generally to a more mechanical side.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always loved exploring how things work and figuring out how to improve them. Over the years I
                have owned a few project cars which I have lovingly rebuilt and cared for, from simple engine repairs to
                full paint jobs.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have a keen passion for photography in which I have been mastering my skills and producing
                increasingly polished photos, and have been commissioned to do work for various parties.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have always loved exploring how things work and figuring out how to improve them - from constructing
                ever larger Lego structures as a child and building my first computer as a very young teen, to buying
                and doing up a bright yellow 1977 Corolla a couple of years back for a summer project. I have a keen and
                agile mind and am always searching for new learning experiences.

                    everyday has proven to be both extremely exciting and challenging at the same time. My main focus
                    has been on improving the processing workflow to increase speed and on integrating with various
                    software solutions.

                    After a 6 year trip with Xero, I decided it was time to do something new - that something new was NV
                    Interactive. We work with some huge worldwide brands building slick websites and applications. My
                    role involved mentoring junior developers and working with project shareholders to come up with a
                    technical solution to fit within a budget. Specialising in Umbraco and .NET development, this role
                    allowed me to grow immensely as a developer. I focused on pushing new processes and technology into
                    our workflow and had some big wins around continuous deployment and moving to Github.

                <p>
                    I started at Xero as a software developer in November 2007, immediately after graduating from
                    Wellington High School. In that time I have worked on a range of projects - from the marketing
                    website, importing hundreds of thousands of lines per day in the banking import environment, to the
                    core accounting application itself. I built the original banking import system that automatically
                    imported customers data into the accounting system. As part of that ongoing project, I also launched
                    an internal management tool used by the banking team to setup and diagnose customers feeds.

                    Kustom Page to experiment with and learn new technologies, and to also learn how to run my own
                    startup.

            <h4>Computers</h4>

            <p>
                I first started programming when I was 12, after coming home from school one day and asking dad how it
                was done. I spent my teenage years building and fixing my own computers with whatever parts I could find
                lying around.
            </p>

            <p>
                Building websites and web applications became my passion around 2007 when I was first introduced to the
                idea of them at Xero. I believe there's still lots of room for innovation in this space and still some
                awesome applications yet to be built.
            </p>

            <h4>Photography</h4>

            <p>
                I picked up my first "proper" camera in 2011 and haven't looked back. I focus on capturing images that
                people haven't seen before, even if it's a common tourist attraction.
            </p>

            <h4>Travelling</h4>

            <p>(I can call this a hobby, right?)</p>

            <p>
                There's very little that compares to travelling to a far away land and exploring their cities, food and
                culture for me. I've always dreamed of living overseas and immersing myself into another way of life.
                Right after school I started saving for a trip to Europe that included the USA, England, Spain and
                Italy. I have since returned to England another time in 2011. In 2013 I spent 3 weeks in the United
                States over summer exploring the Seattle and San Francisco areas.
